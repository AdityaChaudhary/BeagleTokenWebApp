art_heading: Engineering Marvel
art_subtext: Created by Crypto Engineers and Security specialists across the globe, BEAGLE is one of the most robust and secure ERC777 fungible tokens while remaining backward compatible with ERC-20.
art_content_one: While other tokens are still using the old ERC-20 standard, our team architected this token on the ERC-777 level. ERC-777 is future proof and allows our team to create new features for future updates.
art_content_two: Security by design - Several tokens today charges a percentage of fees per transaction which causes vulnerabilities in the system. Based on our security analysis,  several million have been stolen by hackers due to these insecure designs. Therefore, our security engineers have designed new implementations that made the BEAGLE much more secure and robust.
