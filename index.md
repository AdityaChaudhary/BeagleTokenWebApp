rescue_content: Shibas may be the cutest dog breed ever but they aren't the easiest dog breed to keep. For this reason, and admittedly very surprisingly, many Shibas actually need to be rescued worldwide. For this reason, we launched a community effort utilizing the built in Amazon Smile feature to donate for this cause. This no cost method allows any Shiba Inu member to help Rescue Shiba Inus by simply using smile.amazon.com when they place orders and put their preferred non-profit organization to Shiba Inu Rescue Association a 501(c)3. A percentage of your purchases go to support automatically. No cost to you! Our power is in community and as a community we can help Rescue Shibas!
